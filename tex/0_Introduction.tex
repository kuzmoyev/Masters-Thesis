\section{Problem definition}\label{sec:problem-definition}



The difficulty of multiple-F0 estimation lies in the fact that sound sources often overlap in time as well as in frequency. The extracted information is partly ambiguous.
Above all, when musical notes are played in harmonic relations, the partials of higher
notes may overlap completely with those of lower notes. Besides, spectral characteristics of musical instrument sounds are diverse, which increases the ambiguity in the
estimation of partial amplitudes of sound sources. The resulting complexity causes
not only octave ambiguity but also the ambiguity in the estimation of the number of
sources.
